Shearwater is an open source package consisting on designs and instructions for how to build a floating sensor platform to take measurements and collect data related to the measurement and reporting of marine Carbon Dioxide Removal.

The project encompasses 3 major areas of the platform:
* the mechanical design of the physical floating platform and scaffolding which will hold the oceanographic/biogeochemical/meteorological sensors
* the enclosure which routes power and communication to the sensors, networking hardware, and compute hardware
* the software which collects data from the sensors and the platform itself, collates and telemeters this data to a cloud-based server.
