# shearwater

Shearwater is an open source package consisting of designs and instructions for how to build a floating sensor platform to take measurements and collect data related to the Measurement and Reporting of Marine Carbon Dioxide Removal. This project was undertaken as part of a joint public-private collaboration between NOAA/PMEL and Ebb Carbon. We hope that it will be embraced by the community and that it can be maintained beyond just these two entities.

The project encompasses 3 major areas of the platform:
* mechanical: the design of the physical floating platform and scaffolding which will hold the oceanographic/biogeochemical/meteorological sensors
* electrical: the enclosure which routes power and communication to the sensors, stores and powers networking and compute hardware
* software: the software which collects data from the sensors and the platform itself, collates and telemeters this data to a cloud-based server. Note that the software itself lives in a separate repo: [sensor_bridge](https://github.com/ebbcarbon/sensor_bridge)

## Overview
A high-level overview of the project, including screenshots and details about what components to buy to get started, can be found in the [overview document](docs/overview.pdf).
