## Issues and Feature Requests
If you find a bug, or want to request a new feature be added, submit these as an [issue](https://github.com/ebbcarbon/shearwater/issues).

## Doc updates
Currently, most of the documentation lives in a google document shared between Ebb Carbon and NOAA/PMEL. If you are interested in adding to anything, ask Ebb Carbon to add you to the shared PMEL/Ebb Collaboration drive.

Then create a branch off of main, update or add any relevant docs, and submit a Pull Request for Ebb to review and merge into main.
